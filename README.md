# URL Shortening with Python
A python script that shortens URL's

For my next trick I have created a URL shortening script, it does literally just that... It takes a long URl address and condences it into short form.

### EXAMPLE

[https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/falcons-patriots-super-bowl-28-3-lead/1xqfs41k3mfm914f6znfzj5rc9](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/falcons-patriots-super-bowl-28-3-lead/1xqfs41k3mfm914f6znfzj5rc9) - This link brings you to a news article about how the New England Patriots came back and beat the Atlanta Falcons in the superbowl, they came back from 28-3 and ended up winning 34-28. But back to the URL...

The end product looks something like this: [https://tinyurl.com/yxr4u2la](https://tinyurl.com/yxr4u2la)
